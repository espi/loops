# Knowledge base changelog

Dated record of substantive changes to `knowledge/`. The `update-knowledge`
skill appends a new entry here on each research pass. Newest first.

## 2026-06-09 — Initial knowledge base

Seeded from a five-angle deep-research pass triggered by Matt Van Horn's
"WTF Is a Loop? Peter Steinberger vs. Boris Cherny" article.

- Established the primer: definition, lineage (ReAct → AutoGPT → ralph → `/goal`
  → orchestration), key voices, Claude Code mechanics, verification, cost, and
  the three hard stops.
- Curated `sources.md` with confidence levels.
- Corrections captured vs. the source article: the "$297 programming language"
  conflates a YC hackathon datapoint with the separate CURSED project; Gas Town
  patrol loops are run by the Deacon/watchdog tier, not the Mayor.

## 2026-06-09 — First update pass (validation run)

Bounded `update-knowledge` run (baseline was same-day seed): one agent verified
the version-sensitive facts against live docs; one scanned for anything newer
than the seed. All six version facts **confirmed unchanged**. New material added:

- **Dynamic Workflows** (`/workflows`, research preview) — native Claude Code
  orchestration with runtime-enforced caps (16 concurrent, 1,000 agents/workflow,
  token budget). Added to lineage §2 and mechanics §4. **High** (official docs).
- **Anthropic billing split (~Jun 15 2026)** — programmatic entry points move to
  a separate metered credit pool at API list prices; re-prices unattended loops.
  Added to cost §5. **Medium** (secondary incl. Axios; flagged to re-verify).
- Refinements (**High**, docs): Routines marked *research preview*; ralph
  `--max-iterations` *defaults to unlimited* (reinforces the cap rule); `/usage`
  spend breakdown by subagent/skill noted for observability.
- Added, caveated: Huntley's **Loom** (ralph-orchestration evolution; repo more
  modest than talk framing), the **"Loop Engineering"** coinage (Osmani), and a
  reported **$500M uncapped-usage** incident (unnamed — figure unverified).

Open to verify before promoting: the Jun-15 billing terms (primary Anthropic
notice), the $500M figure, and Loom's "orchestrator" framing.
