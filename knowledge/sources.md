# Sources

Curated, deduplicated source list for the loops knowledge base. Confidence
reflects how the claim was verified: **High** = primary source read directly or
identical verbatim across multiple independent sources; **Medium** = consistent
across several secondary sources but primary not directly confirmed; **Low** =
single source / unverified provenance.

Verified as of 2026-06-15. Re-check before relying on version numbers or dates.

## Ecosystem (newer than the seed)

- Geoffrey Huntley — **Loom** ("factory" orchestrator of ralph loops). Repo is
  experimental/proprietary and described more modestly than the talk framing —
  **Medium/Low** (gap between marketing and README).
  https://github.com/ghuntley/loom · talk: AI Engineer Melbourne, Jun 3–4 2026.
- "Loop Engineering" — term popularized by Addy Osmani, crediting Steinberger +
  Cherny — **Medium** (primary Substack 403'd; concept is derivative of KB).
  https://addyo.substack.com/p/loop-engineering

## Known caveats / things to re-verify

- The slogan "the costliest thing in AI coding is managing the agent loop" is a
  community paraphrase, not a sourced Cherny quote.
- The "5 tips for running agents autonomously" is real in substance but not
  published by Cherny as a numbered list — secondary packaging.
- The `/goal` "Codex invented it, Claude copied in 11 days" timeline rests on a
  single secondary source.
- `$47K / 11-day loop` and overnight-billing figures are self-reported anecdotes.
- **`$500M in one month`** uncapped-usage incident — unnamed company, no primary
  disclosure. Treat the figure as unverified; the failure mode is the takeaway.
- **June 15 2026 billing split** — primary Help Center URL (`support.claude.com/
  articles/15036540`) confirmed in index but 403'd to automated fetch. Promoted
  to High based on canonical gist + 15+ independent outlets with consistent
  specifics. Re-confirm against interactive browser access if precision matters.
- **Huntley's Loom** as an "orchestrator of ralph loops" — self-described in
  talk/tweets; the public README is more modest. Re-check as it matures.
- Steinberger / Osmani "Loop Engineering" verbatim — primary X/Substack URLs
  403'd; quotes are snippet-sourced.
- **Roborev creator**: KB previously said Dan Kornas; June 2026 research
  attributes creation to Wes McKinney (@wesmckinn, author of Pandas). Re-verify
  against a primary roborev source (README / About page) before citing a creator.
- **Fable 5 / Mythos 5 suspension**: Multiple secondary sources consistent on the
  US government export-control directive; no primary Anthropic statement URL was
  directly accessible. Verify via anthropic.com/news or status.anthropic.com.
