# Sources

Curated, deduplicated source list for the loops knowledge base. Confidence
reflects how the claim was verified: **High** = primary source read directly or
identical verbatim across multiple independent sources; **Medium** = consistent
across several secondary sources but primary not directly confirmed; **Low** =
single source / unverified provenance.

Verified as of 2026-06-09. Re-check before relying on version numbers or dates.

## Known caveats / things to re-verify

- The slogan "the costliest thing in AI coding is managing the agent loop" is a
  community paraphrase, not a sourced Cherny quote.
- The "5 tips for running agents autonomously" is real in substance but not
  published by Cherny as a numbered list — secondary packaging.
- The `/goal` "Codex invented it, Claude copied in 11 days" timeline rests on a
  single secondary source.
- `$47K / 11-day loop` and overnight-billing figures are self-reported anecdotes.
